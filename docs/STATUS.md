# Color Rough Reference Tool - Status

## Current Direction

This project is a standalone tool for:

```text
Color rough
↓
Prediction generation
↓
Candidate selection
↓
Hand mask creation
↓
Hand reference generation
↓
Save / export
```

The software is not connected to LaughRef.

## Current AI Policy

- Local models only
- No paid APIs
- No cloud dependency in the initial version
- ComfyUI is external
- Models are external
- The software only triggers workflows and manages outputs

Expected generation stack:

- ComfyUI
- SDXL anime-style local model
- ControlNet / img2img
- SDXL Inpainting

---

## Current State

Documentation baseline created.

The repository now has a minimal application folder structure.

Current structure:

```text
src/
└ color_rough_ref_tool/
   ├ core/
   ├ integrations/
   │  └ comfyui/
   └ ui/
tests/
docs/
```

Basic settings storage now exists in `src/color_rough_ref_tool/core/settings.py`.
It can load default settings when no settings file exists and save user settings as JSON.
The default local settings path is `settings/settings.json`, which is ignored by Git.

Project output folder creation now exists in `src/color_rough_ref_tool/core/project_output.py`.
It creates the standard `project_output` subfolders: `input`, `predictions`, `selected`, `masks`, `hand_refs`, `sheets`, and `metadata`.

Workflow placeholder handling now exists in `src/color_rough_ref_tool/integrations/comfyui/workflow_placeholders.py`.
The default workflow file locations are:

```text
workflows/prediction_workflow.json
workflows/hand_inpainting_workflow.json
```

These are placeholders for user-provided ComfyUI workflow JSON files.
They do not include ComfyUI, models, checkpoints, paid APIs, or cloud execution.

Minimal color rough image selection handling now exists in `src/color_rough_ref_tool/core/color_rough_input.py`.
It records a user-selected existing file path as the current color rough.
The same module can now build minimal preview metadata for the selected input image, including file name, absolute path, file URI, and file size.
It can also copy the selected color rough into the project output input folder as `input/color_rough.<extension>`.
It validates supported color rough image extensions: `png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, and `webp`.

No app entry point, UI implementation, ComfyUI settings UI, or ComfyUI execution code exists yet.

## What Should Exist in v0.1

- Color rough loading
- ComfyUI settings
- Prediction generation trigger
- Prediction candidate viewing
- Candidate selection
- Manual hand mask editing
- Hand reference generation trigger
- Result saving
- Sheet export
- Metadata saving

---

## What Is Explicitly Out of Scope

- Local reference search
- Blender / 3D
- Automatic hand detection
- Custom AI training
- Other body parts
- Cloud sharing
- Model bundling

---

## Last Completed Task

Phase 1.4:
Added supported color rough image format validation.

---

## Current Next Task

Phase 2.1:
Add UI/settings field for ComfyUI path or endpoint.

---

## Known Risks / Constraints

- Output quality depends heavily on the user's chosen models and workflows.
- SDXL can be heavy on weaker GPUs.
- Manual masking is intentionally used to avoid adding model-training complexity.
- ComfyUI setup remains a user-side responsibility.

---

## Notes

The software should remain a workflow support tool, not a full image-generation platform.

The development focus is:
- simplicity
- directness
- local no-cost generation workflow
- minimal scope
